# Version 1 stored each turn as a single player index; version 2 stores a set of

# 5 adds recorded agent conversations; version 6 adds web push subscriptions;
# version 7 adds invites, private matches, saved games and referrals; version 8 adds
# rematch links. Version 9 retains match starting snapshots for replay. Version 10
# adds speed matches (a per-move clock and the "timed_out" end reason).
# Version 12 adds guided-builder artifacts, approvals and job state. Version 13 adds
# feedback (users' bugs, suggestions and reports about users, games, matches and
# the platform). Version 14 adds private game test recordings.
# Version 11 adds persisted experiments, assignments and events. Older servers must
# reject new formats rather than lose drafts, re-expose unpublished games or private
# matches, or drop conversations, subscriptions, invites, experiments or feedback.
# Versions 1 through 13 still load with all existing data unchanged.
