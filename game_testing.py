"""Random-walk testing of a game's server code (v2 Game API, Phase 5).

The tester plays whole matches with the game's own move generators
(`computerMove` / `randomMove`): random player counts from the game's
rules, each player randomly a human or a computer with a random stake, a
random seed per walk. After every call it makes the checks the contract
requires — results the runner accepts, views for every player, payouts
that sum to the pot and go to humans only — and it fuzzes `applyMove`
with malformed moves, which must be rejected with InvalidMove (or
return a valid result), never crash. Some calls are run twice with
identical arguments and seed: the results must be identical, because
game logic must be deterministic given `ctx.random`.

A walk is fully derived from its seed, so a failing walk replays
exactly. The seeds of failing walks are returned in the report; the
platform stores them on the game and replays them first on the next
run, as regression seeds. The whole run shares one time budget
(default one second): if not even one walk finishes in it, the game is
reported as too slow.

See docs/server-side-game-api.md (the Testing section).
