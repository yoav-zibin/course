# Player avatars and match feedback

The web portal assigns one of 1,000 animal avatars for every account. The server saves the URL in `User.picture_url`. Existing provider pictures and missing pictures are replaced during the startup
account migration. Later provider logins preserve the assigned animal avatar. Ten red animal avatars identify computers, with the word
“Computer” retained beside them. The same stable player-ID mapping is used in the
portal and game context. Game clients receive picture URLs but choose whether to
render them.

`static/avatars/manifest.json` describes all 1,010 generated PNGs (96 × 96).
User variants combine 20 animals, five palettes, five accessories and two expressions.
Assets total about 7.7 MB; the service worker caches only pictures actually requested,
not the entire catalog. New profile selection uses cosmetic randomness outside
`ctx.random`; game logic and its seeded randomness are unchanged.

In match Controls, **Sound off / Sound on** saves a browser-local preference.
Sounds default off. Five short synthesized cues cover match start, your turn,
explicit win, draw and loss. Unknown results and early endings do not imply a loss.
Browsers require a user gesture before audio can play. Initial loads, repeated polls,
history, pending offline moves, account/match switches and reconnects stay silent.
No audio assets or third-party requests are required.

Button presses, controls opening and confirmed match events have short motion;
OS reduced-motion preferences disable the new animations. No animation changes a
move, result or timing rule.

## Verification

- Python tests cover asset counts/dimensions, persisted assignment, legacy-account
  backfill, provider-picture replacement and repeat-login persistence and stable computer selection.
- JavaScript tests cover event transitions, duplicate suppression and silent replay,
  offline, account/match switch cases.
- Browser tests load real avatar images, enable synthesized audio, confirm a turn
  produces exactly two tones despite repeated updates, save/reload the preference,
  and check reduced-motion behavior on desktop and mobile emulation.

For a manual check, open a match with another account, turn sound on in Controls,
and alternate turns. Check that polling stays silent. Reload, browse match history,
then disconnect/reconnect: old events should not replay. Try the same sequence with
sound off and reduced motion enabled. Real iPhone/iPad Safari audio should also be
checked before presenting; automated Chrome emulation does not replace that check.
